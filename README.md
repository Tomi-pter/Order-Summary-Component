## My process

I started off with a mobile-first development, before creating a media query to adjust for desktop view. 
I firstly structured my html properly before moving on to the css. 
Then I included my @font-face rules to download the necessary fonts needed for the project.
Afterwards i declared the global variables to be used in the latter stages of the css.
Then i proceeded with the rest of the css.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my knowledge of flexbox and grid. I also improved my element positioning.
